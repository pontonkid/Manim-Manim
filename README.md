# Manim Visuals Explained

## üé¨ What is Manim?
Manim is an animation engine that brings concepts to life through motion. Whether you're working with math, programming, or UI/UX, Manim helps break things down visually, making them easier to understand. 

This repository contains various Manim scripts that demonstrate key ideas covered in my article **"[Title of the Article]"**, which explores how Manim can be used in different fields.
