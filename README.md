# Manim Visuals Explained

## üé¨ What is Manim?
Manim is an animation engine that brings concepts to life through motion. Whether you're working with math, programming, or UI/UX, Manim helps break things down visually, making them easier to understand. 

This repository contains various Manim scripts that demonstrate key ideas covered in my article **"[Title of the Article]"**, which explores how Manim can be used in different fields.

## üèó Repo Structure
- `math/` - Animations for mathematical concepts (geometry, graphs, equations).
- `coding/` - Visualizations of algorithms, data structures, and code execution.
- `ui-ux/` - Demonstrations of motion design, UI transitions, and interaction flows.
